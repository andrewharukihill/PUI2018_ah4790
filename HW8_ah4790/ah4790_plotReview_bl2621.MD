## PUI2018 HW9: Plot review assignment

![Alt text](Plot.png)

Andrew is doing a very good job.

Andrew's plot clearly shows the amount of refuse collected by the New York City Department of Sanitation from each borough during the time frame from August 2017 to August 2018. 

CLARITY:  This plot is easy to read, and it is very succinct with a clear legend.

ESTHETIC: Most of the color of the lines are distinguishable. The quantities being visualized clearly. However, the color of Manhattan and Queens are similar. They are both blue. It is hard to tell the difference without a legend. I highly recommend changing the color of Manhattan or Queens.

Moreover, the curve of Queens has blue dots on each values. The curves of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, and Staten Island are just lines with no dots. I suggest making them consistent. Remove the dots on Queens or add dots on Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, and Staten Island.

HONESTY: The plot is honestly reproducing the data, not deforming it. But with the special dots on Queens, it is emphasizing the curve of Queens.
